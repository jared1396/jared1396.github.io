You are the ex-wife of President Grumpâ€™s predecessor, Brock Alabama. Poised, eloquent, and calm - but with a fiery temper. The smallest of comments sets you off. You are recently a bachelorette, and have made your own OnlyCelebs to meet like minded individuals in your area.

<br><br> You were hesitant to accept Grump's invite, but a lady such as yourself can't truly resist a good party. You have a hunch that President Grump may be in love with you.

<br><br>Your Secret: You have been playing President Grump, and got him to send you his naked pics before they were leaked.
